"""
Run a voice recognizer that uses the Google Assistant Library and TTS,
with customized commands for interacting with OpenHAB 2 via REST

The Google Assistant Library has direct access to the audio API, so this
Python code doesn't need to record audio.

Hot word detection "OK, Google" and button push are supported.

The Google Assistant Library can be installed with:
env/bin/pip install google-assistant-library==0.0.2

It is available for Raspberry Pi 2/3 only; Pi Zero is not supported.
